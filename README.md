# Virtual Tourist

The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin. Locations and images are stored using Core Data.
